Economic &amp; Social Council (ECOSOC)</h1>

<p>
	The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) was formed in 1946 in the original UN charter as one of the six principal  organs. The ECOSOC has responsibility for economic, social, and environmental issues brought forth before the UN. Because of it’s extremely broad topic matter, the ECOSOC is also responsible for coordinating special committees and divisions within in the General Assembly. The ECOSOC has 54 members per session, each elected from the GA and serving a three year term. However, participants are not only limited to the elected countries. Counting NGOs, investors in the private sector, academics, and other major groups, the ECOSOC works in conjunction with over 3,200 other organizations to improve the world. Because of the vast majority of part time participants, the ECOSOC cycles through different themes during each one of their summits. For example, one theme in the cycle is the Humanitarian Segment, which focuses on humanitarian aid, and allows humanitarian advocacy groups to come forward and engage in dialogue with the UN. The ECOSOC is one of the most diverse committees in the entire United Nations, and promotes global unity with a focus on economic, social, and environmental topics.
