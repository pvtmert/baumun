International Court of Justice (ICJ)</h1>

<p>
	The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. The Charter of the UN established it in June 1945, providing that all Member States of the United Nations are ipso facto parties to the Court's Statute. The seat of the Court is at the Peace Palace in The Hague (Netherlands). It is composed of 15 judges, who are elected for nine-years term by the General Assembly and the Security Council. In accordance with international law, the Courtâ€™s role is to settle legal disputes submitted by states and further to give advice on legal questions to authorized UN organs and specialized agencies.
	<br>
	The Court has a dual role. Firstly, it settles legal disputes between States submitted to it by them in accordance with international law and secondly, it gives advisory opinions on legal matters referred to it by the authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies. Only States are eligible to appear before the Court in contentious cases.
