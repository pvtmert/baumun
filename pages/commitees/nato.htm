North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)</h1>

<p>
	The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a political and military alliance established in 1949. It is composed of 28 independent countries from North America and Europe.
	<br>
	It was established to safeguard freedom and security of its members, through political and military means. The former is characterized by the protection of democracy and the prevention of conflicts, whereas the latter is concerned with the military capacity of NATO to undertake crisis-managing operations, which are carried out under article 5 of the Washington treaty-NATO’s founding treaty- or through a UN mandate. NATO’s decisions are the expression of the collective will of all members. In addition to the 28 member of NATO, 22 countries are part of NATO’s Partnership for Peace program, which servers to further trust between the ex-Soviet states and the other European countries.
