United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)</h1>

<p>
	The United Nations Development Programme focuses on three main issue areas; sustainable development, democratic governance and peacebuilding, climate and disaster resilience. It works in more than 170 countries and territories to develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience. The UNDP is one of the most important UN institutions. Not at least due to globalization the gap between the developed countries and the still developing countries grew alarmingly high.  Whereas in some places in the world people are out of life-threatening situations, especially the developing countries are confronted with problems such as war, spreading of diseases like AIDS/HIV, illiteracy due to their poverty which collides with their ability to develop and become able to reach a quality which enables them to compete and collaborate with the other countries.  Regarding the world’s society as a union where the biggest success can only be reached by team work and social behaviour. This is why the UN are doing their very best to help the countries develop.
