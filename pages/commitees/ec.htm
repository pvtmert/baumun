The European Council (EC)</h1>

<p>
	The European Council consists of the European Commission President, the head of state or government of all EU countries and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy. Located in Brussels, the European Council was established in 1974, but it gained its formal status in 1992 and became an official EU institution in 2009.The President chaired, convened and represents the EU to the outside world for a once-renewable two-and-a-half-year. The European Council elects it. The European council meets 4 times a year. It decides issues by consensus and in some cases by unanimity or qualified majority. The head of state/government is the only one who can vote. On each issue the European council can pass the issue on to the Council of the EU or it can ask the European Commission to make a proposal to address it. The president can convene additional meetings if there are urgent issues. The European council decides on political priorities and the overall direction of the EU. Moreover, it deals with complex issues that cannot be resolved at lower levels of intergovernmental cooperation. Furthermore, by taking into account EU strategic interest and defense implications it sets the EU common foreign & security policy. Besides this, it nominates and appoints candidates to high profile EU level roles, such as the Commission and the ECB.
